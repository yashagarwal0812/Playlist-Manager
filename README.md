# Playlist Manager

## Project Overview

The Playlist Manager is a C++ application designed to efficiently manage a playlist of songs using a linked list data structure. It allows users to dynamically add, remove, and retrieve songs from the playlist, demonstrating the power and flexibility of linked lists for managing dynamic collections of data.

## Features
